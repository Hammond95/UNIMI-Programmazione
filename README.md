# UNIMI_PROG_JAVAEXERCISES
This repository contains just a bunch of exercises for the Programming Course at University (UNIMI - La Statale Milano).

The assignment is written in Italian, if you want some translation ask for it.
Any suggestion to improve the code is welcome.

Do whatever you want with the code.

-----
If you are studing at UNIMI, and just started to learn programming, PLEASE first try them by yourself several times: 
this is the best way to learn, LEARN BY DOING!!!
Then if you got stucked with some exercises check these exercises I did, but i WARN you: 
this is the way I did, not necessarly the correct way or the best way.
So use them at your own risk! ;)
