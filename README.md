# UNIMI_PROG_JAVAEXERCISES
This repository contains just a bunch of exercises for the Programming Course at University [UNIMI - La Statale Milano](http://www.unimi.it/).

The assignment is written in Italian :it: if you want some translation ask for it.
Any suggestion to improve the code is welcome.

Do whatever you want with the code.

-----
If you are studing at UNIMI, and just started to learn programming, PLEASE first try them by yourself several times: 
this is the best way to learn, **LEARN BY DOING!!!**
Then if you got stucked with some exercises check these exercises I did, but **I WARN YOU**: 
this is the way I did, not necessarly the correct way or the best way.
So use them at your own risk! ;)

_All the exercises are written using Vim, to better exercise the memory not using auto-completion._
